## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Final_232 ‚Äì Summer 2023**

**Question 3:**

a) Example of inconsistent design elements that confuse users

Inconsistency occurs when interface elements behave or appear differently in similar contexts, confusing users.

If a shopping website uses a red ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù button on the homepage and a green ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù button with different font on the product page, users may hesitate because they‚Äôre unsure if both mean the same thing.

**Explanation (From UI Principles):**

According to *Shneiderman‚Äôs Rule #1 ‚Äì Strive for Consistency*
Content 6 - CSE 3411_SAD_Spring‚Ä¶, consistent colors, layout, and actions help users form reliable expectations. The interface should use uniform terminology, colors, and icons throughout the application.
