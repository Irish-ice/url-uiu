## 🌟 Golden Rules of UI Design

### 🔹 Three Golden Rules
1. **Place the User in Control**  
   - Allow undo/redo and flexible navigation.  
   - Example: Online forms that allow users to go back or save progress.

2. **Reduce the User’s Memory Load**  
   - Use visual cues, autofill, and defaults.  
   - Example: Password reset page that pre-fills username.

3. **Make the Interface Consistent**  
   - Maintain consistent layout, colors, and terminology.  
   - Example: Same “Save” button design throughout the app.
